<ol>

 <li>Complete the following algebraic specification for an abstract data type describing a queue of cars at an intersection by providing axioms.</li>

</ol>

algebra QueueOfCars imports Integer, Boolean; introduces sorts Queue, Car;

operations

New: → Queue;

CarArrives: Car x Queue → Queue;

CarDeparts: Queue → Queue;

IsEmpty: Queue → Boolean;

NumberOfCars: Queue → Integer;

Longer: Queue x Integer → Boolean;

FirstCar: Queue → Car;

Equal: Queue x Queue → Boolean;

WhichQueue: Queue x Queue x Car → Integer;

Position: Car x Queue → Integer; constrains New, CarArrives, CarDeparts, IsEmpty, NumberOfCars, Longer, FirstCar, Equal, WhichQueue, Position, so that Queue generated by [New, CarArrives]

<h1>IMPORTANT NOTES</h1>

<ul>

 <li><u>  D</u>escription of the operations:</li>

</ul>

◦ CarArrives adds a car to the end of a queue

◦ CarDeparts removes a car from the front of a queue (the other side than the one where we add cars)

◦ IsEmpty returns true if a queue of cars is empty and false otherwise

◦ Longer returns true if a queue is longer than the integer and false otherwise (assume that the integer is never negative)

◦ NumberOfCars returns the number of cars in the queue

◦ FirstCar returns the car from the front of the queue without deleting it

◦ Equal returns true if number of cars in two queues is equal and false otherwise

◦ WhichQueue examines two queues and returns 1 if a given car is in the first queue, 2 if the car is in the second queue, and 0 if the car is not in the queues.

◦ Position examines if a given car is in a queue and returns the number of cars that are in front of this car in the queue (closer to the front of the queue) or -1 if this car is not in the queue

<ul>

 <li>You should provide only the axioms (including the for all and end statements)</li>

 <li>Be precise in terms of both syntax and symbols that you use</li>

 <li>Assume that error constant is available</li>

</ul>

◦ Assume that applying CarDeparts to empty queue generates error

◦ Assume that applying FirstCar to empty queue generates error

◦ Assume that = = and + operators are defined for the sort Integer

<ul>

 <li>Write neatly (preferably using a word processor)</li>

</ul>
